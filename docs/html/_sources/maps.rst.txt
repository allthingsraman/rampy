Maps
====

Rampy offers the possiblity to analyse maps from Raman spectrometers using the ``rampy.maps`` module.

Line and 2D Maps saved in CSV or TXT format from Horiba and Renishaw spectrometers can be loaded, and various data treatments can be performed afterwards.

An Jupyter notebook example of processing a map of Raman spectra is `provided here <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/blob/master/examples/Maps_example.ipynb>`_.
